DESCRIPTION OF THE ENDPOINTS IN INVETORY.JS --------------------------------------------------------
1. GET request to path /api/inventory/:username
- if user exists, returns an array of InventoryItemSchema objects, in alphabetical order
- if inventory is empty, returns empty array
- for the above 2 cases, the status code is 200
- otw if the user doesn't exist, return {"error": "No inventory list detected."} and status code 404
- the returned object will be json

2. POST request to path /api/inventory/:username
- adds item to the users inventory if it has not already been added
- if successful, status 200 and {"success": "Item was successfully added."}
- if unsuccessful due to attempting to add a duplicate item, status 409 and {error: "Item already exists in user's inventory."} are returned
- otw if a different error occurs (i.e the user specified isnt in the database), return status 404 and {"error": "Item could not be added."}
- returned object will be json
- since im sorting the items alphabetically by the name field, can you ensure that the name has a capital first letter?
- also the dates need to be converted to ISO 8601 strings so that later i can reconvert them into date objects when im checking for expired items but i believe that when you turn the object into json, that this should happen by default so you may not need to actually do anything

3. GET request to path /api/inventory/:username/expiring
- if there are no expiring items, the return should be status 200 and {"expiring": []}
- if there are items, then it should be status 200 and {"expiring": [InventoryItemSchema]}
- the list will be sorted alphabetically
- if the user doesnt exist or some other error occurs, the return wil be status 404 and {"error": "No inventory list detected."}
- the returned object will be json

4. GET request to path /api/inventory/:username/expired
- if there are no expired items, the return should be status 200 and {"expired": []}
- if there are items, then it should be status 200 and {"expired": [InventoryItemSchema]}
- the list will be sorted alphabetically
- if the user doesnt exist or some other error occurs, the return wil be status 404 and {"error": "No inventory list detected."}
- the returned object will be json

5. GET request to path /api/inventory/:username/:itemName
